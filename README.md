# Software Engineering Practices

DoiT International has many generalized engineering practices that cover major languages we use in all our products. These pages represent our collective experience of various best practices that we have developed over time. We are confident that the new team members or other teams would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to make it available publicly when possible.
