  unless the there are strong reasons for adding a new framework to our
  codebase.

# Frameworks

## Client Side Frameworks

The list of approved client side frameworks for the CMP:

* [React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Formik](https://formik.org/)

## Service Side Frameworks

The list of approved server side frameworks for the CMP:

* Framework 1
* Framework 2

## Need a New Framework?

If you strongly believe we should add yet another framework to our stack, please discuss this with your Staff Software Engineer \(SSE\). Provide a reason why this framework is necessary. Some of the considerations your SSE will try to validate are:

* License \(generally we only approve frameworks with MIT license\)
* How well maintained the framework is
* How it's going to fit into our stack
* Is it going to replace another framework we use?
